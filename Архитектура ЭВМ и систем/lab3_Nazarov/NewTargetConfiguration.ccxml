    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates the C64x core, L1D, L1P, L2 Cache, EDMA, QDMA, Interrupt Selector, McBSP(3), Timer(3), TCP, VCP, EMIF interfacing with Async, SDRAM and Generic sync RAM Memory models. Does not support HPI, PCI, Utopia. This is a device cycle accurate configuration and hence useful for applications development and benchmarking at the device level. &#10; Note on other configurations of this device: &#10; * There is a corresponding device &quot;Functional&quot; simulator that is faster, but does not implement cycle accuracy. To use the Functional Simulator, go to the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab of this configuration &amp; select &quot;Functional&quot; in &quot;Simulator Type&quot;, in the &quot;CPU Properties&quot; dialogue. &#10; * There is even faster simulator configuration at the device level called the &quot;C6416 Device Functional Compiled Simulator&quot; (available in the General Setup), based on the compiled simulation technology. But this would not support some of the debug and analysis features. Use this configuration if speed is the utmost care-about and if you are ready to give up device level cycle accuracy &amp; debug / analysis features. &#10; * For core level algorithm development and benchmarking, you may choose the &quot;C64xx CPU Cycle Accurate Simulator&quot; (compiled simulation based or otherwise) for faster simulations than the device configuration.." id="C6416 Device Cycle Accurate Simulator, Little Endian">
